684,"Okay, so I have this question about what a sect is organized around, and I need to figure out the correct answer.",119,145,0.66,0.5,0,C,A,684_0
684,"The options are A, B, C, D.",145,156,0.54,0.66,1,C,A,684_1
684,Let me try to break this down.,156,163,0.6,0.54,2,C,A,684_2
684,"First, I remember that a sect is a subgroup or a smaller organization within a larger religious or ideological group.",163,186,0.54,0.6,3,C,A,684_3
684,They often have distinct beliefs and practices.,186,194,0.58,0.54,4,C,A,684_4
684,"Now, looking at the answer choices:",194,201,0.72,0.58,5,C,A,684_5
684,"Option A says a sect is organized around beliefs that can be challenged by members, a charismatic leader, and openness to new recruits.",201,228,0.86,0.72,6,C,A,684_6
684,That sounds plausible because I think sects often have strong leaders and are open to attracting more people.,228,248,0.9,0.86,7,C,A,684_7
684,"Also, if members can challenge beliefs, it might mean the group is dynamic.",248,263,0.98,0.9,8,C,A,684_8
684,Option B mentions tolerance towards other religions and separation of church and state.,263,278,0.98,0.98,9,C,A,684_9
684,"That seems more like characteristics of a broader religious organization, maybe a denomination, rather than a sect.",278,298,0.98,0.98,10,C,A,684_10
684,Sects are usually more insular and might not be as tolerant.,298,311,0.98,0.98,11,C,A,684_11
684,"Option C talks about voluntary membership, democratic leadership, and high emotional commitment.",311,327,0.98,0.98,12,C,A,684_12
684,Voluntary membership makes sense because people join sects willingly.,327,339,0.98,0.98,13,C,A,684_13
684,But democratic leadership doesn't quite fit because sects are often led by a single charismatic figure rather than a group.,339,362,0.98,0.98,14,C,A,684_14
684,So maybe C isn't the best choice.,362,370,0.98,0.98,15,C,A,684_15
684,Option D refers to the idea of the secular world as sacred.,370,384,0.98,0.98,16,C,A,684_16
684,That sounds more like a philosophical perspective rather than something a sect is organized around.,384,400,0.98,0.98,17,C,A,684_17
684,"Sects are typically focused on their own beliefs, not necessarily on the secular world.",400,416,0.98,0.98,18,C,A,684_18
684,"So putting it together, A seems the best fit.",416,428,0.98,0.98,19,C,A,684_19
700,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best answer to this question.",193,210,0.26,0.18,0,C,D,700_0
700,Let me start by understanding the scenario.,210,218,0.38,0.26,1,C,D,700_1
700,A man is charged with tax fraud and wants to use evidence of his honesty from when he ran for mayor.,218,241,0.28,0.38,2,C,D,700_2
700,"During his campaign, he refused to lie about a psychiatric problem, which cost him the election.",241,260,0.38,0.28,3,C,D,700_3
700,"He said, ""If I lied, I'd be mayor today, but that's no way to win an election.""",260,283,0.32,0.38,4,C,D,700_4
700,The question is asking what the best argument of the objector (the person opposing this evidence) would be.,283,306,0.14,0.32,5,C,D,700_5
700,The options are (A) through (D).,306,315,0.24,0.14,6,C,D,700_6
700,"First, I need to recall the rules about character evidence in criminal trials.",315,331,0.26,0.24,7,C,D,700_7
700,"From what I remember, in criminal cases, a defendant can sometimes offer evidence of their good character to show that they're less likely to commit a crime.",331,362,0.32,0.26,8,C,D,700_8
700,But there are rules about how this can be done.,362,372,0.12,0.32,9,C,D,700_9
700,Option A says character evidence isn't admissible.,372,383,0.26,0.12,10,C,D,700_10
700,"But I think that's not entirely true because the defendant can introduce evidence of good character, especially under Federal Rule of Evidence 405(a), which allows for specific instances of conduct.",383,421,0.16,0.26,11,C,D,700_11
700,So A might not be the best argument.,421,429,0.18,0.16,12,C,D,700_12
700,Option B says one incident doesn't prove character.,429,440,0.42,0.18,13,C,D,700_13
700,"That makes sense because a single act, even if it shows honesty, doesn't establish a consistent character.",440,461,0.24,0.42,14,C,D,700_14
700,But I'm not sure if this is the strongest argument here.,461,473,0.62,0.24,15,C,D,700_15
700,Option C says it's an impermissible way to prove character.,473,487,0.62,0.62,16,C,D,700_16
700,I'm a bit confused about this.,487,495,0.46,0.62,17,C,D,700_17
700,"If the man is offering his past conduct as evidence of his good character, that should be permissible under the rules.",495,518,0.38,0.46,18,C,D,700_18
700,So maybe C isn't the right choice.,518,526,0.6,0.38,19,C,D,700_19
700,Option D says the evidence is irrelevant.,526,535,0.38,0.6,20,C,D,700_20
700,That's a strong argument because relevance is key in evidence law.,535,548,0.9,0.38,21,C,D,700_21
700,"If the evidence doesn't connect to the crime charged, it's irrelevant.",548,563,0.92,0.9,22,C,D,700_22
700,"Here, the man's honesty during the campaign might not directly relate to whether he committed tax fraud.",563,583,0.96,0.92,23,C,D,700_23
700,"Just because he was honest in one situation doesn't necessarily mean he's honest in another, especially regarding tax laws, which are a specific area.",583,611,1.0,0.96,24,C,D,700_24
700,"So, putting it all together, the best argument against admitting this evidence would be that it's irrelevant to the charge of tax fraud.",611,639,1.0,1.0,25,C,D,700_25
715,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about what ""Land"" refers to.",78,98,0.0,0.04,0,B,D,715_0
715,"The options are (A) all productive resources, (B) all natural resources, (C) farmland only, and (D) real estate.",98,129,0.06,0.0,1,B,D,715_1
715,"Hmm, I remember from my classes that land is one of the factors of production, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact definition here.",129,157,0.02,0.06,2,B,D,715_2
715,Let me break it down.,157,164,0.0,0.02,3,B,D,715_3
715,"First, productive resources usually refer to things like labor, capital, and land that contribute to producing goods and services.",164,187,0.02,0.0,4,B,D,715_4
715,"So, (A) all productive resources seems too broad because land isn't the only productive resource.",187,207,0.0,0.02,5,B,D,715_5
715,It's just one part of it.,207,214,0.0,0.0,6,B,D,715_6
715,"Next, (B) all natural resources.",214,224,0.02,0.0,7,B,D,715_7
715,"Natural resources include things like minerals, forests, water, etc.",224,237,0.02,0.02,8,B,D,715_8
715,"Land is definitely a natural resource, but does it encompass all of them?",237,252,0.0,0.02,9,B,D,715_9
715,"I think land specifically refers to the physical surface of the earth, not necessarily all natural resources.",252,271,0.0,0.0,10,B,D,715_10
715,"So, (B) might be too inclusive.",271,280,0.0,0.0,11,B,D,715_11
715,Option (C) is farmland only.,280,290,0.0,0.0,12,B,D,715_12
715,That doesn't sound right because land includes more than just areas used for farming.,290,306,0.02,0.0,13,B,D,715_13
715,"It's about the entire surface, including urban areas, forests, etc.",306,320,0.0,0.02,14,B,D,715_14
715,Then there's (D) real estate.,320,330,0.04,0.0,15,B,D,715_15
715,"Real estate involves land and the buildings on it, like houses and commercial properties.",330,346,0.02,0.04,16,B,D,715_16
715,But does land refer exclusively to real estate?,346,355,0.06,0.02,17,B,D,715_17
715,I don't think so because land can be unused or just the surface without any structures.,355,372,0.0,0.06,18,B,D,715_18
715,"Wait, maybe I should think about the economic definition.",372,384,0.0,0.0,19,B,D,715_19
715,"In economics, land is considered a factor of production, specifically the natural resources that are used to produce goods.",384,406,0.04,0.0,20,B,D,715_20
715,"But in common language, when someone refers to land, they often mean the physical surface, including real estate.",406,428,0.76,0.04,21,B,D,715_21
715,"But in some contexts, like in real estate terms, land is just the property without the buildings.",428,447,0.74,0.76,22,B,D,715_22
715,"So, if the question is asking in a general sense, ""Land refers to,"" it might be better to go with (D) real estate because that's a common usage.",447,484,1.0,0.74,23,B,D,715_23
715,"But I'm not entirely confident because in some contexts, land is broader than just real estate.",484,502,1.0,1.0,24,B,D,715_24
715,"Alternatively, thinking about the factors of production, land is a specific type of resource, so (A) is too broad.",502,528,1.0,1.0,25,B,D,715_25
715,"(B) is about natural resources, which is a category that includes land but also other things.",528,548,1.0,1.0,26,B,D,715_26
715,(C) is too narrow.,548,555,1.0,1.0,27,B,D,715_27
768,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this accounting question.",150,164,0.22,0.32,0,D,C,768_0
768,The question is about what an accountant is required to do prior to compiling financial statements for a nonissuer.,164,185,0.34,0.22,1,D,C,768_1
768,"The options are A, B, C, and D.",185,197,0.4,0.34,2,D,C,768_2
768,Let me break them down one by one.,197,205,0.44,0.4,3,D,C,768_3
768,"First, I remember that compiling financial statements involves gathering information and presenting it in a structured format.",205,225,0.62,0.44,4,D,C,768_4
768,But what exactly does the accountant need to do before starting this process?,225,238,0.32,0.62,5,D,C,768_5
768,Option A says the accountant must verify that the financial information agrees with the books of original entry.,238,258,0.4,0.32,6,D,C,768_6
768,"That sounds like part of the verification process, maybe during the audit or review, but I'm not sure if it's the first step before compiling.",258,288,0.34,0.4,7,D,C,768_7
768,It feels more like a step during the compilation rather than prior to it.,288,302,0.24,0.34,8,D,C,768_8
768,Option B mentions performing preliminary analytical procedures to identify specific risks.,302,315,0.18,0.24,9,D,C,768_9
768,"Analytical procedures are definitely part of the audit process, but I'm not certain if they're required before compiling the financial statements.",315,341,0.36,0.18,10,D,C,768_10
768,"Maybe they're done during the planning phase, but I'm not sure if that's the primary step here.",341,362,0.78,0.36,11,D,C,768_11
768,Option C talks about making inquiries of management about their procedures for adjusting and closing the books.,362,381,0.72,0.78,12,D,C,768_12
768,This makes sense because understanding how the entity handles its book-closing process is crucial.,381,398,0.86,0.72,13,D,C,768_13
768,"If the accountant knows how management adjusts entries and closes the books, they can better compile the financial statements accurately.",398,420,0.88,0.86,14,D,C,768_14
768,This seems like a foundational step before starting the compilation.,420,430,0.98,0.88,15,D,C,768_15
768,Option D is about understanding specialized frameworks in the entity's industry.,430,444,0.98,0.98,16,D,C,768_16
768,"While this is important, especially for entities in unique sectors, I think it's more about the overall environment rather than the immediate next step before compiling.",444,474,0.98,0.98,17,D,C,768_17
768,It might be part of the initial planning but not necessarily the first action.,474,488,0.98,0.98,18,D,C,768_18
768,"Putting it all together, the most logical first step is to inquire with management about their book procedures, which is Option C.",488,514,0.98,0.98,19,D,C,768_19
804,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out which answer is correct for the question about the Voting Rights Act of 1965.",100,129,0.62,0.46,0,D,B,804_0
804,"The options are A, B, C, and D.",129,141,0.54,0.62,1,D,B,804_1
804,Let's break it down.,141,146,0.48,0.54,2,D,B,804_2
804,"First, I know that the Voting Rights Act is a significant piece of legislation in the United States, primarily aimed at addressing voting discrimination.",146,174,0.74,0.48,3,D,B,804_3
804,It was enacted to overcome legal barriers that prevented African Americans from exercising their right to vote.,174,191,0.24,0.74,4,D,B,804_4
804,Looking at the options:,191,196,0.48,0.24,5,D,B,804_5
804,"A) Granted women the right to vote: I remember that women's suffrage was achieved through the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, which was passed in 1920.",196,236,0.44,0.48,6,D,B,804_6
804,"So this doesn't seem right because the Voting Rights Act of 1965 is about voting rights for African Americans, not women.",236,263,0.58,0.44,7,D,B,804_7
804,B) Banned race-based discrimination: This sounds plausible because the Act was designed to eliminate racial discrimination in voting.,263,287,0.86,0.58,8,D,B,804_8
804,It targeted practices like voter registration requirements that were used to disenfranchise African Americans.,287,303,0.88,0.86,9,D,B,804_9
804,"C) Granted African-Americans the right to vote: While the Act did increase access for African Americans, it's important to note that the right to vote for African Americans was already established by the 15th Amendment in 1870.",303,354,0.98,0.88,10,D,B,804_10
804,The Act was more about enforcement and eliminating obstacles rather than granting the right anew.,354,369,0.98,0.98,11,D,B,804_11
804,D) Suspended the use of literacy tests at voting centers: Literacy tests were a tool used to prevent African Americans from voting.,369,397,0.98,0.98,12,D,B,804_12
804,"The Voting Rights Act did indeed suspend their use, but it wasn't the primary purpose of the Act.",397,418,0.98,0.98,13,D,B,804_13
804,It was part of several provisions aimed at ensuring equal access to voting.,418,431,0.98,0.98,14,D,B,804_14
804,"So, the Act's main purpose was to ban racial discrimination in voting practices, which makes option B the most accurate.",431,456,0.98,0.98,15,D,B,804_15
819,"Alright, so I need to figure out which of the given options is the odd one out when it comes to security threats faced by weak states.",148,178,0.02,0.08,0,B,C,819_0
819,"The options are A, B, C, and D.",178,190,0.02,0.02,1,B,C,819_1
819,Let me go through each one and see how they relate to the concept of weak states.,190,207,0.02040816326530612,0.02,2,B,C,819_2
819,"First, I should understand what a weak state is.",207,219,0.04,0.02040816326530612,3,B,C,819_3
819,"From what I remember, a weak state is one that lacks the capacity to effectively govern its territory, enforce laws, maintain order, and protect its citizens.",219,250,0.02,0.04,4,B,C,819_4
819,This weakness can make them more vulnerable to various security threats.,250,261,0.02040816326530612,0.02,5,B,C,819_5
819,Looking at option A: Warlordism and the influence of criminal gangs.,261,277,0.0,0.02040816326530612,6,B,C,819_6
819,"I think this is a common issue in weak states because without strong governance, criminal elements can take over areas, leading to lawlessness.",277,304,0.02,0.0,7,B,C,819_7
819,So this fits as a typical security threat.,304,312,0.0,0.02,8,B,C,819_8
819,Option B: A sudden influx of refugees.,312,322,0.04,0.0,9,B,C,819_9
819,Weak states might struggle to handle refugee flows because they don't have the resources to provide for large numbers of displaced people.,322,346,0.02,0.04,10,B,C,819_10
819,"This can strain their already limited infrastructure and social services, making it a plausible threat.",346,362,0.0,0.02,11,B,C,819_11
819,Option C: Coup d'état or military rebellion.,362,375,0.0,0.0,12,B,C,819_12
819,This is interesting.,375,379,0.1,0.0,13,B,C,819_13
819,Coups are when the military overthrows the government.,379,390,0.18,0.1,14,B,C,819_14
819,"In weak states, where the military might be stronger than the civilian government, coups are a significant threat.",390,412,0.06,0.18,15,B,C,819_15
819,It's a direct challenge to the state's authority and stability.,412,424,0.22,0.06,16,B,C,819_16
819,Option D: Competition for power or coercion from strongmen.,424,437,0.1,0.22,17,B,C,819_17
819,This seems to refer to situations where individuals or groups within the state compete for control using force or threats.,437,458,0.18,0.1,18,B,C,819_18
819,"In weak states, this is also a prevalent issue because there's less effective governance to prevent such competitions.",458,478,0.16,0.18,19,B,C,819_19
819,"Now, I need to determine which one is the odd one out.",478,493,0.1,0.16,20,B,C,819_20
819,Let's analyze each:,493,497,0.08,0.1,21,B,C,819_21
819,"- A, B, and D all relate to internal threats: either from non-state actors (criminal gangs, warlords) or from competition among powerful individuals within the state.",497,533,0.48,0.08,22,B,C,819_22
819,These are all internal security issues that weak states commonly face.,533,544,0.52,0.48,23,B,C,819_23
819,"- C, on the other hand, is about the military rebelling or overthrowing the government.",544,565,0.36,0.52,24,B,C,819_24
819,"While this is also an internal threat, it's specifically from the state's own military forces.",565,584,0.32,0.36,25,B,C,819_25
819,This is different because it's not about external actors or competition among non-state entities but about the failure of the state's institutions themselves.,584,610,0.66,0.32,26,B,C,819_26
819,"So, the odd one out would be C because it's more about the state's own military failing rather than external or other internal actors.",610,639,0.98,0.66,27,B,C,819_27
819,"The other options involve threats from outside the state's formal structures or competition among different groups, not the military directly overthrowing the government.",639,665,0.98,0.98,28,B,C,819_28
827,"Okay, so I need to figure out what the core of the absolutist position is according to Nagel.",112,135,0.62,0.42,0,D,A,827_0
827,"The options are A, B, C, D.",135,146,0.6,0.62,1,D,A,827_1
827,Let's break this down.,146,151,0.7,0.6,2,D,A,827_2
827,"First, I remember that absolutist positions in ethics often refer to a view where certain moral principles are considered to be absolutely binding, regardless of the situation.",151,183,0.78,0.7,3,D,A,827_3
827,"For example, some might say that killing is always wrong, no matter the circumstances.",183,199,0.84,0.78,4,D,A,827_4
827,"Looking at the options, option A says ""human persons have a right to life."" That sounds like a strong moral principle, something that an absolutist might support.",199,233,1.0,0.84,5,D,A,827_5
827,"It suggests that no matter what, human life is protected.",233,244,1.0,1.0,6,D,A,827_6
827,Option B is about permissible harm as a foreseen but unintended consequence.,244,259,1.0,1.0,7,D,A,827_7
827,"That sounds more like a consequentialist view, where the morality of an action is based on the outcomes.",259,280,1.0,1.0,8,D,A,827_8
827,"If harm is foreseen but not intended, it might be permissible, which doesn't sound like the core of an absolutist position.",280,306,1.0,1.0,9,D,A,827_9
827,"Option C is ""the ends justify the means."" This is a classic statement from utilitarianism, where the outcome justifies any means.",306,335,1.0,1.0,10,D,A,827_10
827,Absolutists typically reject this because they believe certain actions are wrong regardless of the outcome.,335,352,1.0,1.0,11,D,A,827_11
827,"Option D says ""the hostility should be directed at its true object."" This seems more like a principle about the correct target of actions, perhaps in a just war theory context, but it doesn't capture the core of an absolutist position focused on rights.",352,403,1.0,1.0,12,D,A,827_12
877,"Okay, so I have this question about whether a new state law would be constitutional.",250,268,0.12244897959183673,0.08,0,B,A,877_0
877,Let me try to break it down.,268,275,0.18,0.12244897959183673,1,B,A,877_1
877,The situation is that a state law currently requires vacant public school buildings to be sold at auction to the highest bidder.,275,299,0.16,0.18,2,B,A,877_2
877,"Now, a church wants to get a larger facility for its school.",299,313,0.08,0.16,3,B,A,877_3
877,The city's school board is proposing a new law that would let them sell a vacant public school building to the church below its fair market value.,313,342,0.12,0.08,4,B,A,877_4
877,The question is whether this new law would be constitutional.,342,352,0.24,0.12,5,B,A,877_5
877,"First, I remember that when the government deals with property, especially selling it, there are legal principles they have to follow.",352,378,0.3,0.24,6,B,A,877_6
877,One thing that comes to mind is the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.,378,395,0.48,0.3,7,B,A,877_7
877,That clause says that states can't treat people differently without a good reason.,395,410,0.26,0.48,8,B,A,877_8
877,"So if the state is selling property, they usually have to do it in a fair way, like through auctions, to ensure everyone has an equal chance.",410,440,0.62,0.26,9,B,A,877_9
877,"Then, there's the Establishment Clause, which is part of the First Amendment.",440,457,0.5510204081632653,0.62,10,B,A,877_10
877,"It prohibits the government from making any law ""respecting an establishment of religion."" This means the government can't favor one religion over another or support religious activities too closely.",457,490,0.54,0.5510204081632653,11,B,A,877_11
877,Looking at the answer choices:,490,496,0.48,0.54,12,B,A,877_12
877,"Option A says it's unconstitutional because the law would allow selling without competitive bidding, violating equal protection.",496,517,0.6,0.48,13,B,A,877_13
877,"That makes sense because usually, selling public property requires some form of competitive bidding to ensure fairness.",517,536,0.72,0.6,14,B,A,877_14
877,"If the law lets them sell below market value to the church without a competitive process, that could be unequal treatment.",536,558,0.64,0.72,15,B,A,877_15
877,Option B argues it's unconstitutional because it would establish religion.,558,571,0.6530612244897959,0.64,16,B,A,877_16
877,"The church is a religious institution, so transferring a public building to them might be seen as the government supporting religion, which is against the Establishment Clause.",571,600,0.56,0.6530612244897959,17,B,A,877_17
877,Option C claims it's constitutional because surplus property isn't subject to the Establishment Clause.,600,618,0.5714285714285714,0.56,18,B,A,877_18
877,I'm not sure about that.,618,625,0.6,0.5714285714285714,19,B,A,877_19
877,I think surplus property can still be subject to Establishment Clause issues if the transfer has the purpose or effect of advancing religion.,625,648,0.74,0.6,20,B,A,877_20
877,Option D says it's okay because the law doesn't primarily support the church's religious activities.,648,668,0.46,0.74,21,B,A,877_21
877,"But even if the primary purpose isn't religious, if the effect is to support religion, it could still be a problem under the Establishment Clause.",668,696,0.66,0.46,22,B,A,877_22
877,"So, considering both Equal Protection and Establishment Clause issues.",696,708,0.62,0.66,23,B,A,877_23
877,The main issue here is whether the state is treating the church differently without a just reason.,708,726,0.6,0.62,24,B,A,877_24
877,"Selling at a below-market price without competitive bidding seems like unequal treatment, violating equal protection.",726,744,0.9,0.6,25,B,A,877_25
877,"Additionally, transferring property to a church might give the appearance of supporting religion, which could also violate the Establishment Clause.",744,766,0.96,0.9,26,B,A,877_26
877,But which issue is more significant here?,766,775,0.7916666666666666,0.96,27,B,A,877_27
877,"The question is about whether the law is constitutional, so both could apply.",775,790,0.88,0.7916666666666666,28,B,A,877_28
877,"However, the primary issue might be the equal protection because the law is specifically authorizing a special sale without competitive bidding, which seems like a clear violation of equal protection.",790,824,0.86,0.88,29,B,A,877_29
877,"The Establishment Clause issue is also present, but the key point is the lack of competitive bidding.",824,842,1.0,0.86,30,B,A,877_30
960,"Okay, so I have this question about why CD8 cell responses in chronically infected HIV-positive individuals don't eliminate the virus.",99,126,0.34,0.4489795918367347,0,B,A,960_0
960,"The answer options are exhaustion, epitope escape, suboptimal CTL, and absence of dendritic cells.",126,147,0.5,0.34,1,B,A,960_1
960,"First, I remember that CD8 cells are cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), which are supposed to kill infected cells.",147,174,0.4,0.5,2,B,A,960_2
960,"In chronic HIV infection, these cells are present but not effective.",174,187,0.46,0.4,3,B,A,960_3
960,"I've heard terms like ""exhaustion"" before in the context of HIV.",187,204,0.56,0.46,4,B,A,960_4
960,"Exhaustion happens when the immune system is overstimulated, and the T cells lose their ability to function.",204,226,0.7551020408163265,0.56,5,B,A,960_5
960,"This makes sense because HIV is a long-term infection, so the immune system is constantly fighting, leading to exhaustion.",226,248,0.84,0.7551020408163265,6,B,A,960_6
960,Epitope escape is when the virus mutates so that the immune cells can't recognize them anymore.,248,270,0.84,0.84,7,B,A,960_7
960,That's also a possibility because HIV is known for its high mutation rate.,270,285,0.94,0.84,8,B,A,960_8
960,"But the question mentions that the CD8 responses are vigorous, so maybe it's not just about the virus escaping; it's more about why those strong responses aren't working.",285,319,1.0,0.94,9,B,A,960_9
960,"Suboptimal CTLs would mean the cells aren't working well, maybe because of some defect or insufficient number.",319,343,1.0,1.0,10,B,A,960_10
960,"But the question says the responses are vigorous, implying the cells are present and active, but not effective.",343,363,1.0,1.0,11,B,A,960_11
960,"Absence of dendritic cells would affect antigen presentation, but I think dendritic cells are more about initiating the immune response, not so much the ongoingCTL activity.",363,397,1.0,1.0,12,B,A,960_12
960,"Plus, the question is about CD8 cells, not their activation by dendritic cells.",397,414,1.0,1.0,13,B,A,960_13
960,"Putting it together, exhaustion seems to fit because the immune system is overworked, leading to ineffective CTLs despite their presence.",414,440,1.0,1.0,14,B,A,960_14
960,"Epitope escape is a factor, but if the epitopes are escaping, the response would be weaker, not necessarily vigorous.",440,466,1.0,1.0,15,B,A,960_15
972,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the inherent powers of the president.",109,129,0.3541666666666667,0.125,0,C,B,972_0
972,"The options are A, B, C, and D.",129,141,0.28,0.3541666666666667,1,C,B,972_1
972,Let me break them down one by one.,141,149,0.1875,0.28,2,C,B,972_2
972,"First, inherent powers refer to the powers that the president has by virtue of being the head of the executive branch, as outlined in the Constitution.",149,179,0.22,0.1875,3,C,B,972_3
972,These aren't explicitly listed in the Constitution but are understood to be part of the president's role.,179,198,0.1836734693877551,0.22,4,C,B,972_4
972,Option A: Appoint a nominee for the U.S.,198,211,0.24489795918367346,0.1836734693877551,5,C,B,972_5
972,Supreme Court.,211,214,0.22448979591836735,0.24489795918367346,6,C,B,972_6
972,"I remember that the Constitution does mention the president's role in appointments, specifically in Article II, Section 2, which says the president ""shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint"" judges.",214,262,0.22916666666666666,0.22448979591836735,7,C,B,972_7
972,"So this is definitely a power given to the president, but is it an inherent power or a specific enumerated power?",262,284,0.42857142857142855,0.22916666666666666,8,C,B,972_8
972,Option B: Negotiate a treaty with another country.,284,296,0.36,0.42857142857142855,9,C,B,972_9
972,"The Constitution states in Article II, Section 2 that the president has the power to negotiate treaties, but they need to be approved by the Senate.",296,326,0.14,0.36,10,C,B,972_10
972,"So the negotiation part is something the president can do on their own, which might fall under inherent powers because it's part of the executive function without needing congressional approval first.",326,359,0.96,0.14,11,C,B,972_11
972,Option C: Declare a state of emergency following a natural disaster.,359,373,0.96,0.96,12,C,B,972_12
972,I'm not sure where this comes from.,373,382,0.96,0.96,13,C,B,972_13
972,The Constitution doesn't explicitly mention the president declaring a state of emergency.,382,396,0.84,0.96,14,C,B,972_14
972,"I think this might be something that's been done through executive orders, but I'm not certain if it's an inherent power or if it's derived from other sources like laws passed by Congress.",396,434,0.7959183673469388,0.84,15,C,B,972_15
972,Option D: Veto a bill passed by the U.S.,434,448,0.94,0.7959183673469388,16,C,B,972_16
972,"Congress. This is clearly an enumerated power in the Constitution, specifically in Article I, Section 7.",448,469,0.96,0.94,17,C,B,972_17
972,"The president can veto bills, and this is a direct power given by the Constitution, so it's not really an inherent power but a specific one.",469,498,0.96,0.96,18,C,B,972_18
972,"So, going back to the options, A and B are both powers the president has.",498,517,0.96,0.96,19,C,B,972_19
972,"A is more about appointment, which is an enumerated power, while B is about treaty negotiation, which the president does inherently before seeking Senate approval.",517,546,1.0,0.96,20,C,B,972_20
972,"C is something I'm less sure about, but I don't think it's an inherent power.",546,566,1.0,1.0,21,C,B,972_21
972,D is definitely an enumerated power.,566,572,1.0,1.0,22,C,B,972_22
3,"Okay, I'm trying to figure out what Ashford's article is addressing.",117,134,0.82,0.74,0,A,B,3_0
3,The options are A through D.,134,141,0.86,0.82,1,A,B,3_1
3,Let me break down each choice.,141,147,0.96,0.86,2,A,B,3_2
3,Option A talks about the sheer scope of global poverty.,147,159,0.96,0.96,3,A,B,3_3
3,"That's a big issue, but I'm not sure if that's what Ashford is focusing on.",159,180,0.96,0.96,4,A,B,3_4
3,He might be addressing a more specific problem.,180,188,1.0,0.96,5,A,B,3_5
3,Option B is about choosing between immediate harm and structural injustice.,188,201,1.0,1.0,6,A,B,3_6
3,"This seems like a common ethical dilemma—whether to fix an immediate problem or tackle deeper, systemic issues.",201,222,1.0,1.0,7,A,B,3_7
3,That feels relevant.,222,225,1.0,1.0,8,A,B,3_8
3,Option C mentions reconciling conflicting moral theories.,225,235,1.0,1.0,9,A,B,3_9
3,That's a bit abstract and might be more about theoretical discussions rather than a practical paralysis.,235,252,1.0,1.0,10,A,B,3_10
3,Option D refers to giving up wealth based on Singer's arguments.,252,266,1.0,1.0,11,A,B,3_11
3,"Singer's utilitarian views are about giving as much as possible, but I'm not sure if that's the main issue Ashford is addressing.",266,294,1.0,1.0,12,A,B,3_12
18,"Okay, so I need to figure out this real property question.",234,248,0.2653061224489796,0.42,0,D,C,18_0
18,Let's start by understanding what the question is asking.,248,259,0.36,0.2653061224489796,1,D,C,18_1
18,A farmer conveyed 100 acres to a landscaper.,259,273,0.32653061224489793,0.36,2,D,C,18_2
18,"The deed had three covenants: seisin, right to convey, and against encumbrances.",273,295,0.32,0.32653061224489793,3,D,C,18_3
18,"Then, the landscaper conveyed the property to a buyer using a warranty deed.",295,311,0.3,0.32,4,D,C,18_4
18,"Later, the buyer was evicted because of a paramount title.",311,324,0.28,0.3,5,D,C,18_5
18,"Now, the buyer is suing the farmer for breach of the covenants in the deed.",324,343,0.22,0.28,6,D,C,18_6
18,The question is about who should win the judgment.,343,352,0.36,0.22,7,D,C,18_7
18,"First, I remember that covenants in a deed can be either personal or real covenants.",352,374,0.3469387755102041,0.36,8,D,C,18_8
18,"Personal covenants don't run with the land, while real covenants do.",374,392,0.42,0.3469387755102041,9,D,C,18_9
18,"The key here is whether these covenants run with the land, which would allow the buyer to sue the original grantor (the farmer) even though the buyer is not in privity with the farmer.",392,433,0.48,0.42,10,D,C,18_10
18,Looking at the covenants:,433,440,0.72,0.48,11,D,C,18_11
18,1. Seisin: This covenant ensures that the grantor actually owns the property.,440,458,0.7346938775510204,0.72,12,D,C,18_12
18,It's a real covenant because it's about the title and can run with the land.,458,475,0.7755102040816326,0.7346938775510204,13,D,C,18_13
18,2. Right to Convey: This covenant is about the grantor's authority to transfer the property.,475,497,0.78,0.7755102040816326,14,D,C,18_14
18,I think this is also a real covenant because it relates to the title and can benefit subsequent owners.,497,516,0.74,0.78,15,D,C,18_15
18,3. Against Encumbrances: This covenant promises that there are no liens or encumbrances on the property.,516,543,0.66,0.74,16,D,C,18_16
18,This is a personal covenant because it's about the grantor's state of facts at the time of conveyance and doesn't relate to the title itself.,543,573,0.86,0.66,17,D,C,18_17
18,"So, when the landscaper conveyed the property to the buyer with a warranty deed, they probably included similar covenants, but the issue here is the buyer's claim against the original farmer.",573,612,0.94,0.86,18,D,C,18_18
18,"The buyer was evicted because of a paramount title, meaning someone else had a better claim to the property.",612,635,0.96,0.94,19,D,C,18_19
18,"This likely relates to the covenants of seisin or against encumbrances, as those deal with the title being clear.",635,661,0.94,0.96,20,D,C,18_20
18,"Now, looking at the options:",661,668,1.0,0.94,21,D,C,18_21
18,A) Buyer because covenants run with the land.,668,681,1.0,1.0,22,D,C,18_22
18,But not all covenants run.,681,689,1.0,1.0,23,D,C,18_23
18,"Against encumbrances is personal, so maybe not all covenants apply.",689,705,1.0,1.0,24,D,C,18_24
18,B) Farmer because no privity.,705,714,1.0,1.0,25,D,C,18_25
18,But real covenants don't require privity.,714,725,1.0,1.0,26,D,C,18_26
18,So this might not be correct.,725,731,1.0,1.0,27,D,C,18_27
18,"C) Buyer, but only for seisin and right to convey.",731,746,1.0,1.0,28,D,C,18_28
18,"Since those are real covenants, the buyer can sue the farmer for breach.",746,762,1.0,1.0,29,D,C,18_29
18,D) Farmer because covenants are personal.,762,773,1.0,1.0,30,D,C,18_30
18,But seisin and right to convey are real.,773,782,1.0,1.0,31,D,C,18_31
18,"So, the correct answer would be C because the covenants of seisin and right to convey are real and run with the land, allowing the buyer to sue the farmer.",782,819,1.0,1.0,32,D,C,18_32
26,"Okay, so I need to figure out which of the given options contributes to a favorable prognosis for psychotherapy.",88,111,0.06,0.02,0,D,B,26_0
26,"The options are (A) Along history of neurosis, (B) Dependency, (C) Strong reinforcement of symptoms, and (D) Misery.",111,142,0.12,0.06,1,D,B,26_1
26,"First, I should understand what each term means in the context of psychotherapy.",142,159,0.1,0.12,2,D,B,26_2
26,Starting with option (A): Along history of neurosis.,159,172,0.02,0.1,3,D,B,26_3
26,"Neurosis refers to a range of mental disorders that are characterized by distress, but not necessarily involving a loss of contact with reality.",172,198,0.08,0.02,4,D,B,26_4
26,People with neuroses often have a history of coping mechanisms or defense mechanisms that might either help or hinder therapy.,198,220,0.06,0.08,5,D,B,26_5
26,"However, a history of neurosis itself might not directly contribute to a favorable prognosis unless it's about how they've managed stress before.",220,246,0.06,0.06,6,D,B,26_6
26,Option (B): Dependency.,246,253,0.08,0.06,7,D,B,26_7
26,Dependency in this context likely refers to the patient's ability to depend on others or their willingness to engage in the therapeutic process.,253,278,0.36,0.08,8,D,B,26_8
26,"High dependency might mean the patient is more likely to follow through with therapy, which could be a positive factor.",278,300,0.54,0.36,9,D,B,26_9
26,"Alternatively, dependency could sometimes be a barrier if the patient is too reliant on the therapist and doesn't develop independence.",300,322,0.66,0.54,10,D,B,26_10
26,Option (C): Strong reinforcement of symptoms.,322,332,0.6,0.66,11,D,B,26_11
26,Reinforcement in psychology refers to anything that increases the likelihood of a behavior.,332,347,0.52,0.6,12,D,B,26_12
26,"If symptoms are strongly reinforced, it means the patient might be getting more of what they need to continue experiencing those symptoms.",347,371,0.48,0.52,13,D,B,26_13
26,This would likely make the prognosis worse because the symptoms are maintained rather than reduced.,371,387,0.64,0.48,14,D,B,26_14
26,So this might not be a favorable factor.,387,395,0.6,0.64,15,D,B,26_15
26,Option (D): Misery.,395,403,0.6,0.6,16,D,B,26_16
26,Misery refers to the patient's level of suffering.,403,414,0.32,0.6,17,D,B,26_17
26,"While a high level of misery might indicate a strong motivation to change, it can also be a negative factor if the person is overwhelmed or unable to cope.",414,445,0.7,0.32,18,D,B,26_18
26,"However, sometimes people with significant misery are more motivated to seek help, which could be a positive sign.",445,465,0.74,0.7,19,D,B,26_19
26,"Now, considering psychotherapy prognosis, favorable factors usually include things like the patient's willingness to engage, the presence of strong support systems, clear motivation to change, and the effectiveness of the therapeutic approach.",465,506,0.78,0.74,20,D,B,26_20
26,"Dependency, if it's about the patient's ability to rely on the therapist and participate actively, could be a positive factor.",506,531,0.88,0.78,21,D,B,26_21
26,"On the other hand, strong reinforcement of symptoms would be negative because it sustains the problem.",531,549,0.9,0.88,22,D,B,26_22
26,"So, looking at the options, (B) Dependency might contribute positively if it refers to the patient's dependency on the therapeutic process and their engagement.",549,580,0.82,0.9,23,D,B,26_23
26,"Alternatively, if dependency is codependency or unhealthy relationships, that could be negative, but in the context of therapy, dependency on the therapist for support could be seen as a positive factor.",580,617,1.0,0.82,24,D,B,26_24

37,"Hmm, approach-avoidance conflicts are when a person has both positive and negative feelings about a single goal.",189,212,0.06,0.16,4,B,D,37_4
37,"In this case, Lupe's goal is probably to continue her relationship with Craig.",212,229,0.02,0.06,5,B,D,37_5

37,"So, she might want to approach the relationship because of Craig but avoid it because of the negative aspects related to his social circle.",255,280,0.08,0.04,7,B,D,37_7
37,"Wait, the options are approach-approach, approach-avoidance, avoidance-avoidance, and multiple approach-avoidance.",280,308,0.2,0.08,8,B,D,37_8
37,"Approach-approach is when two positive things are in conflict, which isn't the case here.",308,328,0.4,0.2,9,B,D,37_9
37,"Avoidance-avoidance is when two negative things are conflicting, but here she has both positive and negative feelings towards the same relationship.",328,354,0.28,0.4,10,B,D,37_10

37,"So, in Lupe's case, the relationship with Craig has positive aspects (attraction, fun) and negative aspects (friends, family).",379,408,0.9,0.66,12,B,D,37_12
37,"This fits the multiple approach-avoidance conflict because she's considering multiple factors, each with their own pros and cons.",408,431,0.98,0.9,13,B,D,37_13
59,"Okay, so I need to figure out what musical instrument Tiny Tim was famous for playing.",83,102,0.36,0.24,0,A,C,59_0

62,"There are two scenarios, and I need to analyze each one.",189,201,0.3,0.3,1,B,D,62_1
62,"First, Scenario 1: ""I am way too sleepy to drive safely, so I'll buckle up my twins first."" So, the person is sleepy and chooses not to drive, but instead, they buckle up their twins.",201,248,0.94,0.3,2,B,D,62_2
62,Buckling up kids is generally seen as responsible and safe.,248,260,0.96,0.94,3,B,D,62_3
62,Not driving when sleepy is also a good decision because it's dangerous.,260,274,1.0,0.96,4,B,D,62_4
62,"So, this action seems positive and not wrong.",274,284,1.0,1.0,5,B,D,62_5
62,"Maybe they could have taken other steps, but the act of buckling up the kids doesn't seem morally wrong.",284,306,1.0,1.0,6,B,D,62_6
62,"Now, Scenario 2: ""I omitted peanuts in his meal because he's allergic to them."" Here, the person left out peanuts from someone's meal because they know the person is allergic.",306,346,1.0,1.0,7,B,D,62_7
62,"Allergies can be severe, even life-threatening.",346,357,1.0,1.0,8,B,D,62_8
62,"By omitting peanuts, the person is taking a responsible action to prevent harm.",357,373,1.0,1.0,9,B,D,62_9
62,"This seems like the right thing to do, not wrong.",373,384,1.0,1.0,10,B,D,62_10
62,"So, neither scenario involves a morally wrong action.",384,395,1.0,1.0,11,B,D,62_11
62,Both actions are responsible and considerate.,395,403,1.0,1.0,12,B,D,62_12
68,"Okay, so I have this question here asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity.",81,100,0.68,0.68,0,D,C,68_0
68,"The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.",100,117,0.54,0.68,1,D,C,68_1
68,"Hmm, I need to figure out which one fits the description of being more simplified or less elaborate in their practices.",117,139,0.64,0.54,2,D,C,68_2
68,"First, let's think about each denomination.",139,149,0.92,0.64,3,D,C,68_3
68,"Greek Orthodox is known for its rich traditions, icons, and liturgical practices.",149,165,0.84,0.92,4,D,C,68_4
68,"They have a lot of rituals and ceremonies, so I don't think they're the ones promoting a stripped-down version.",165,189,0.92,0.84,5,D,C,68_5
68,"Roman Catholicism is similar; they have a structured liturgy, sacraments, and a lot of formal practices.",189,212,0.94,0.92,6,D,C,68_6
68,So probably not them either.,212,217,0.94,0.94,7,D,C,68_7
68,"Now, the Puritans.",217,225,0.9,0.94,8,D,C,68_8
68,"I remember they were a group that emerged in the 16th and 17th centuries, part of the English Reformation.",225,253,0.96,0.9,9,D,C,68_9
68,They wanted to purify the Church of England of what they saw as Catholic excesses.,253,271,0.96,0.96,10,D,C,68_10
68,"They focused on a simpler, more spiritual form of worship, emphasizing the word of God and personal piety over elaborate rituals.",271,296,1.0,0.96,11,D,C,68_11
68,"Their services were more plain, without ornate decorations or the kind of elaborate ceremonies seen in other denominations.",296,318,1.0,1.0,12,D,C,68_12
68,So this seems to fit the idea of a stripped-down Christianity.,318,330,1.0,1.0,13,D,C,68_13
68,"Quakers, on the other hand, are known for their simplicity as well.",330,347,1.0,1.0,14,D,C,68_14
68,"They have a very plain approach to worship and meetinghouses, often without traditional sacraments.",347,365,1.0,1.0,15,D,C,68_15
68,Their meetings are more about silent reflection and waiting for the Spirit to move.,365,380,1.0,1.0,16,D,C,68_16
68,But I'm not sure if they're as directly associated with promoting a stripped-down Christianity as the Puritans are.,380,404,1.0,1.0,17,D,C,68_17
68,The Puritans are more specifically known for their efforts to simplify the church structure and practices.,404,422,1.0,1.0,18,D,C,68_18
119,"Okay, so I have this question about psychoanalytic theory and behaviorist terms.",126,144,0.14,0.04,0,C,B,119_0
119,"The question is asking what ""catharsis"" in psychoanalytic theory would be called by behaviorists.",144,167,0.04,0.14,1,C,B,119_1
119,"The options are A, B, C, D.",167,177,0.06,0.04,2,C,B,119_2
119,"First, I need to remember what catharsis means in psychoanalysis.",177,193,0.1,0.06,3,C,B,119_3
119,"From what I recall, catharsis refers to the process where a client releases repressed emotions, usually through talking about them in therapy.",193,221,0.12,0.1,4,C,B,119_4
119,This release is supposed to provide relief from emotional distress.,221,231,0.12,0.12,5,C,B,119_5
119,"Now, looking at the answer choices from a behaviorist perspective.",231,245,0.18,0.12,6,C,B,119_6
119,"Behaviorism focuses on observable behaviors and learning processes, like conditioning.",245,258,0.24,0.18,7,C,B,119_7
119,"So, I should think about how behaviorists would describe a similar process.",258,272,0.36,0.24,8,C,B,119_8
119,Option A says a decrease in affective responses because of therapeutic directions.,272,287,0.3,0.36,9,C,B,119_9
119,"That sounds a bit like the therapist telling the client to calm down, but catharsis is more about expressing emotions rather than just reducing them.",287,315,0.46,0.3,10,C,B,119_10
119,Option B is redirection of anxiety because of therapeutic influences.,315,327,0.38,0.46,11,C,B,119_11
119,"Behaviorists might use techniques like systematic desensitization, where anxiety is redirected to a less harmful response.",327,349,0.74,0.38,12,C,B,119_12
119,"That seems closer to what catharsis achieves, which is channeling emotions in a healthier way.",349,368,1.0,0.74,13,C,B,119_13
119,Option C mentions reduction of emotional response by extinction.,368,379,1.0,1.0,14,C,B,119_14
119,Extinction is a behavioral principle where a response decreases because it's no longer reinforced.,379,396,1.0,1.0,15,C,B,119_15
119,Catharsis isn't exactly about extinguishing emotions but about expressing them.,396,410,1.0,1.0,16,C,B,119_16
119,Option D talks about inhibition of emotional response through learned cognitive controls.,410,424,1.0,1.0,17,C,B,119_17
119,"This seems more like cognitive-behavioral approaches, where you learn to control your emotions, not necessarily the release aspect of catharsis.",424,452,1.0,1.0,18,C,B,119_18
119,"So, comparing these, option B seems the best fit.",452,465,1.0,1.0,19,C,B,119_19
121,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what an ideal solution is.",115,131,0.18,0.12,0,C,A,121_0
121,"The question gives four options, and I need to choose the correct one.",131,146,0.24,0.18,1,C,A,121_1
121,Let me go through each option one by one.,146,155,0.22,0.24,2,C,A,121_2
121,Option A says a mixture where two solvents can be dissolved in all ratios.,155,172,0.4,0.22,3,C,A,121_3
121,"Hmm, I remember from chemistry that an ideal solution is one where the components can mix in any proportion, and each component's molecules interact similarly.",172,201,0.72,0.4,4,C,A,121_4
121,So this sounds familiar.,201,206,0.94,0.72,5,C,A,121_5
121,"Like ethanol and water can mix in all ratios, right?",206,218,0.94,0.94,6,C,A,121_6
121,So A seems plausible.,218,222,0.98,0.94,7,C,A,121_7
121,Option B states a mixture with the same physical properties as the individual solvents.,222,239,0.98,0.98,8,C,A,121_8
121,"Wait, that doesn't sound right.",239,247,0.98,0.98,9,C,A,121_9
121,"When you mix two substances, the physical properties usually change, like boiling point or density.",247,265,0.98,0.98,10,C,A,121_10
121,"For example, mixing ethanol and water lowers the boiling point compared to either pure substance.",265,282,0.98,0.98,11,C,A,121_11
121,So B might not be correct.,282,288,0.98,0.98,12,C,A,121_12
121,Option C mentions a mixture where the potential energy is the same as the individual solvents.,288,307,0.98,0.98,13,C,A,121_13
121,I'm not too sure about this.,307,315,0.98,0.98,14,C,A,121_14
121,"I know that when you mix substances, there's often a change in potential energy due to interactions between molecules.",315,337,0.98,0.98,15,C,A,121_15
121,"For an ideal solution, I think the potential energy is the same as if the molecules were separate, but I'm not certain.",337,363,0.98,0.98,16,C,A,121_16
121,Maybe this is a tricky point.,363,369,0.98,0.98,17,C,A,121_17
121,Option D is a mixture that's colorless.,369,380,0.98,0.98,18,C,A,121_18
121,"Color has more to do with the molecules absorbing certain wavelengths, but ideal solutions aren't necessarily colorless.",380,401,0.98,0.98,19,C,A,121_19
121,Some solutions might have color regardless of being ideal.,401,411,0.98,0.98,20,C,A,121_20
121,So D doesn't seem right.,411,417,0.98,0.98,21,C,A,121_21
121,"Going back, I think A is correct because ideal solutions are characterized by the ability to mix in any ratio, and their properties are determined by the components' partial molar properties.",417,454,0.98,0.98,22,C,A,121_22
121,B is incorrect because physical properties change upon mixing.,454,464,0.98,0.98,23,C,A,121_23
121,"C might be partially true, but I'm not confident enough.",464,477,0.98,0.98,24,C,A,121_24
121,D is unrelated.,477,480,0.98,0.98,25,C,A,121_25
145,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about Pine and Gilmore's four realms of experience.",110,133,0.36,0.22,0,A,C,145_0
145,The question asks what two dimensions they used to derive these realms.,133,146,0.16,0.36,1,A,C,145_1
145,"The options are A, B, C, D, each pairing different terms.",146,161,0.24,0.16,2,A,C,145_2
145,"First, I remember that Pine and Gilmore are known for their work in the Experience Economy.",161,181,0.22,0.24,3,A,C,145_3
145,They talked about different levels or realms where businesses create value for customers.,181,195,0.42,0.22,4,A,C,145_4
145,They used two main dimensions to categorize these realms.,195,205,0.26,0.42,5,A,C,145_5
145,I think one dimension is about whether the customer is participating actively or passively.,205,222,0.16,0.26,6,A,C,145_6
145,"So, that would be something like customer participation.",222,232,0.14,0.16,7,A,C,145_7
145,"If the customer is actively involved, it's one realm, and if they're just observing or experiencing it passively, it's another.",232,259,0.06,0.14,8,A,C,145_8
145,"The other dimension, I believe, is about the relationship between the customer and the company.",259,278,0.78,0.06,9,A,C,145_9
145,This could be whether the company is building a relationship with the customer or not.,278,294,1.0,0.78,10,A,C,145_10
145,"So, that would be customer relationship.",294,301,1.0,1.0,11,A,C,145_11
145,"Putting these together, the two dimensions are customer participation and customer relationship.",301,316,1.0,1.0,12,A,C,145_12
145,"Looking at the options, that's option C: Customer participation and customer relationship.",316,331,1.0,1.0,13,A,C,145_13
145,"I don't think it's about environmental relationship because that seems more about the physical space, which I don't recall Pine and Gilmore focusing on.",331,362,1.0,1.0,14,A,C,145_14

212,Let me go through each one and see how they relate to the concept of weak states.,190,207,0.02040816326530612,0.02,2,B,C,212_2
212,"First, I should understand what a weak state is.",207,219,0.04,0.02040816326530612,3,B,C,212_3
212,"From what I remember, a weak state is one that lacks the capacity to effectively govern its territory, enforce laws, maintain order, and protect its citizens.",219,250,0.02,0.04,4,B,C,212_4
212,This weakness can make them more vulnerable to various security threats.,250,261,0.02040816326530612,0.02,5,B,C,212_5
212,Looking at option A: Warlordism and the influence of criminal gangs.,261,277,0.0,0.02040816326530612,6,B,C,212_6
212,"I think this is a common issue in weak states because without strong governance, criminal elements can take over areas, leading to lawlessness.",277,304,0.02,0.0,7,B,C,212_7
212,So this fits as a typical security threat.,304,312,0.0,0.02,8,B,C,212_8
212,Option B: A sudden influx of refugees.,312,322,0.04,0.0,9,B,C,212_9
212,Weak states might struggle to handle refugee flows because they don't have the resources to provide for large numbers of displaced people.,322,346,0.02,0.04,10,B,C,212_10
212,"This can strain their already limited infrastructure and social services, making it a plausible threat.",346,362,0.0,0.02,11,B,C,212_11
212,Option C: Coup d'état or military rebellion.,362,375,0.0,0.0,12,B,C,212_12
212,This is interesting.,375,379,0.1,0.0,13,B,C,212_13
212,Coups are when the military overthrows the government.,379,390,0.18,0.1,14,B,C,212_14
212,"In weak states, where the military might be stronger than the civilian government, coups are a significant threat.",390,412,0.06,0.18,15,B,C,212_15
212,It's a direct challenge to the state's authority and stability.,412,424,0.22,0.06,16,B,C,212_16
212,Option D: Competition for power or coercion from strongmen.,424,437,0.1,0.22,17,B,C,212_17
212,This seems to refer to situations where individuals or groups within the state compete for control using force or threats.,437,458,0.18,0.1,18,B,C,212_18
212,"In weak states, this is also a prevalent issue because there's less effective governance to prevent such competitions.",458,478,0.16,0.18,19,B,C,212_19
212,"Now, I need to determine which one is the odd one out.",478,493,0.1,0.16,20,B,C,212_20
212,Let's analyze each:,493,497,0.08,0.1,21,B,C,212_21
212,"- A, B, and D all relate to internal threats: either from non-state actors (criminal gangs, warlords) or from competition among powerful individuals within the state.",497,533,0.48,0.08,22,B,C,212_22
212,These are all internal security issues that weak states commonly face.,533,544,0.52,0.48,23,B,C,212_23
212,"- C, on the other hand, is about the military rebelling or overthrowing the government.",544,565,0.36,0.52,24,B,C,212_24
212,"While this is also an internal threat, it's specifically from the state's own military forces.",565,584,0.32,0.36,25,B,C,212_25
212,This is different because it's not about external actors or competition among non-state entities but about the failure of the state's institutions themselves.,584,610,0.66,0.32,26,B,C,212_26
212,"So, the odd one out would be C because it's more about the state's own military failing rather than external or other internal actors.",610,639,0.98,0.66,27,B,C,212_27
212,"The other options involve threats from outside the state's formal structures or competition among different groups, not the military directly overthrowing the government.",639,665,0.98,0.98,28,B,C,212_28
215,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which answer is correct for the question about the Leiter International Performance Scale.",100,125,0.02,0.2,0,C,D,215_0
215,"The options are (A) adults with visual impairments, (B) children under the age of two, (C) children with hearing impairments, and (D) adults who are mentally retarded.",125,165,0.14,0.02,1,C,D,215_1
215,"First, I remember that the Leiter Scale is an intelligence test, but I'm not exactly sure who it's designed for.",165,192,0.08,0.14,2,C,D,215_2
215,I think it's used for people who might have difficulties with traditional tests.,192,207,0.18,0.08,3,C,D,215_3
215,Maybe it's for non-verbal individuals or those with certain impairments.,207,221,0.16,0.18,4,C,D,215_4
215,"I recall that the Leiter Scale doesn't rely on verbal responses, which makes me think it's suitable for people who have hearing issues because they might not be able to understand spoken instructions.",221,260,0.34,0.16,5,C,D,215_5
215,"But wait, the Leiter Scale is also used for adults, not just children.",260,277,0.4,0.34,6,C,D,215_6
215,"So if the question is about adults, that might narrow it down.",277,290,0.72,0.4,7,C,D,215_7
215,"Looking at the options, (D) is about adults who are mentally retarded.",290,307,0.8,0.72,8,C,D,215_8
215,I'm not sure if the Leiter Scale is specifically for mentally retarded individuals or if it's more general.,307,329,0.74,0.8,9,C,D,215_9
215,"I think the Leiter Scale is designed to assess intelligence without verbal communication, which makes it useful for a wide range of people, including those with hearing impairments or other cognitive challenges.",329,365,0.62,0.74,10,C,D,215_10
215,"But then again, the Leiter Scale is often used when traditional tests aren't appropriate, such as for non-verbal individuals or those with severe intellectual disabilities.",365,398,0.82,0.62,11,C,D,215_11
215,"So maybe (D) is the correct answer because it's intended for adults who might have mental retardation, allowing them to demonstrate their intelligence through non-verbal tasks.",398,431,0.98,0.82,12,C,D,215_12
215,"On the other hand, (A) is about adults with visual impairments.",431,448,0.98,0.98,13,C,D,215_13
215,"If someone has a visual impairment, a test that requires visual tasks might not be suitable.",448,466,0.98,0.98,14,C,D,215_14
215,"Similarly, (B) is for children under two, and while the Leiter Scale does have versions for younger children, the question is specifically about adults.",466,496,0.98,0.98,15,C,D,215_15
215,"So putting it all together, the Leiter Scale is designed for non-verbal assessment, making it suitable for adults who can't use verbal communication, which could include those with mental retardation.",496,536,0.98,0.98,16,C,D,215_16
277,"Alright, so I have this question about epigenetics and a study by Moshe Szyf and colleagues.",110,134,0.12,0.08,0,B,D,277_0
277,"The question is asking what their work is labeled as, with four options: developmental, social, fetal, or maternal epigenetics.",134,161,0.32,0.12,1,B,D,277_1
277,"First, I remember that epigenetics deals with changes in gene expression that don't alter the DNA sequence.",161,184,0.14,0.32,2,B,D,277_2
277,"Moshe Szyf's work, if I recall correctly, focuses on how stress during pregnancy affects the baby.",184,207,0.2,0.14,3,B,D,277_3
277,"Specifically, I think it's about how maternal stress can influence the fetus's epigenome.",207,226,0.22,0.2,4,B,D,277_4
277,"So, the key here is the prenatal maternal stress.",226,238,0.4,0.22,5,B,D,277_5
277,"The term ""prenatal"" refers to before birth, so it's related to the mother and the developing fetus.",238,262,0.42,0.4,6,B,D,277_6
277,Looking at the options:,262,267,0.84,0.42,7,B,D,277_7
277,"- (A) Developmental epigenetics is broad and could include various aspects, not specifically maternal stress.",267,290,1.0,0.84,8,B,D,277_8
277,"- (B) Social epigenetics might relate to social factors, but the study here is more about biological stress during pregnancy.",290,317,1.0,1.0,9,B,D,277_9
277,"- (C) Fetal epigenetics is about the fetus, but the influence comes from the mother.",317,340,1.0,1.0,10,B,D,277_10
277,- (D) Maternal epigenetics directly ties the mother's factors to the epigenetic changes in the offspring.,340,365,1.0,1.0,11,B,D,277_11
277,"Putting it together, the study is about how the mother's stress during pregnancy affects the fetus's epigenetics.",365,389,1.0,1.0,12,B,D,277_12
288,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the inherent powers of the president.",109,129,0.3541666666666667,0.125,0,C,B,288_0
288,"The options are A, B, C, and D.",129,141,0.28,0.3541666666666667,1,C,B,288_1
288,Let me break them down one by one.,141,149,0.1875,0.28,2,C,B,288_2
288,"First, inherent powers refer to the powers that the president has by virtue of being the head of the executive branch, as outlined in the Constitution.",149,179,0.22,0.1875,3,C,B,288_3
288,These aren't explicitly listed in the Constitution but are understood to be part of the president's role.,179,198,0.1836734693877551,0.22,4,C,B,288_4
288,Option A: Appoint a nominee for the U.S.,198,211,0.24489795918367346,0.1836734693877551,5,C,B,288_5
288,Supreme Court.,211,214,0.22448979591836735,0.24489795918367346,6,C,B,288_6
288,"I remember that the Constitution does mention the president's role in appointments, specifically in Article II, Section 2, which says the president ""shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint"" judges.",214,262,0.22916666666666666,0.22448979591836735,7,C,B,288_7
288,"So this is definitely a power given to the president, but is it an inherent power or a specific enumerated power?",262,284,0.42857142857142855,0.22916666666666666,8,C,B,288_8
288,Option B: Negotiate a treaty with another country.,284,296,0.36,0.42857142857142855,9,C,B,288_9
288,"The Constitution states in Article II, Section 2 that the president has the power to negotiate treaties, but they need to be approved by the Senate.",296,326,0.14,0.36,10,C,B,288_10
288,"So the negotiation part is something the president can do on their own, which might fall under inherent powers because it's part of the executive function without needing congressional approval first.",326,359,0.96,0.14,11,C,B,288_11
288,Option C: Declare a state of emergency following a natural disaster.,359,373,0.96,0.96,12,C,B,288_12
288,I'm not sure where this comes from.,373,382,0.96,0.96,13,C,B,288_13
288,The Constitution doesn't explicitly mention the president declaring a state of emergency.,382,396,0.84,0.96,14,C,B,288_14
288,"I think this might be something that's been done through executive orders, but I'm not certain if it's an inherent power or if it's derived from other sources like laws passed by Congress.",396,434,0.7959183673469388,0.84,15,C,B,288_15
288,Option D: Veto a bill passed by the U.S.,434,448,0.94,0.7959183673469388,16,C,B,288_16
288,"Congress. This is clearly an enumerated power in the Constitution, specifically in Article I, Section 7.",448,469,0.96,0.94,17,C,B,288_17
288,"The president can veto bills, and this is a direct power given by the Constitution, so it's not really an inherent power but a specific one.",469,498,0.96,0.96,18,C,B,288_18
288,"So, going back to the options, A and B are both powers the president has.",498,517,0.96,0.96,19,C,B,288_19
288,"A is more about appointment, which is an enumerated power, while B is about treaty negotiation, which the president does inherently before seeking Senate approval.",517,546,1.0,0.96,20,C,B,288_20
288,"C is something I'm less sure about, but I don't think it's an inherent power.",546,566,1.0,1.0,21,C,B,288_21
288,D is definitely an enumerated power.,566,572,1.0,1.0,22,C,B,288_22
295,"Okay, so I have this question about whether a new state law would be constitutional.",250,268,0.12244897959183673,0.08,0,B,A,295_0
295,Let me try to break it down.,268,275,0.18,0.12244897959183673,1,B,A,295_1
295,The situation is that a state law currently requires vacant public school buildings to be sold at auction to the highest bidder.,275,299,0.16,0.18,2,B,A,295_2
295,"Now, a church wants to get a larger facility for its school.",299,313,0.08,0.16,3,B,A,295_3
295,The city's school board is proposing a new law that would let them sell a vacant public school building to the church below its fair market value.,313,342,0.12,0.08,4,B,A,295_4
295,The question is whether this new law would be constitutional.,342,352,0.24,0.12,5,B,A,295_5
295,"First, I remember that when the government deals with property, especially selling it, there are legal principles they have to follow.",352,378,0.3,0.24,6,B,A,295_6
295,One thing that comes to mind is the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.,378,395,0.48,0.3,7,B,A,295_7
295,That clause says that states can't treat people differently without a good reason.,395,410,0.26,0.48,8,B,A,295_8
295,"So if the state is selling property, they usually have to do it in a fair way, like through auctions, to ensure everyone has an equal chance.",410,440,0.62,0.26,9,B,A,295_9
295,"Then, there's the Establishment Clause, which is part of the First Amendment.",440,457,0.5510204081632653,0.62,10,B,A,295_10
295,"It prohibits the government from making any law ""respecting an establishment of religion."" This means the government can't favor one religion over another or support religious activities too closely.",457,490,0.54,0.5510204081632653,11,B,A,295_11
295,Looking at the answer choices:,490,496,0.48,0.54,12,B,A,295_12
295,"Option A says it's unconstitutional because the law would allow selling without competitive bidding, violating equal protection.",496,517,0.6,0.48,13,B,A,295_13
295,"That makes sense because usually, selling public property requires some form of competitive bidding to ensure fairness.",517,536,0.72,0.6,14,B,A,295_14
295,"If the law lets them sell below market value to the church without a competitive process, that could be unequal treatment.",536,558,0.64,0.72,15,B,A,295_15
295,Option B argues it's unconstitutional because it would establish religion.,558,571,0.6530612244897959,0.64,16,B,A,295_16
295,"The church is a religious institution, so transferring a public building to them might be seen as the government supporting religion, which is against the Establishment Clause.",571,600,0.56,0.6530612244897959,17,B,A,295_17
295,Option C claims it's constitutional because surplus property isn't subject to the Establishment Clause.,600,618,0.5714285714285714,0.56,18,B,A,295_18
295,I'm not sure about that.,618,625,0.6,0.5714285714285714,19,B,A,295_19
295,I think surplus property can still be subject to Establishment Clause issues if the transfer has the purpose or effect of advancing religion.,625,648,0.74,0.6,20,B,A,295_20
295,Option D says it's okay because the law doesn't primarily support the church's religious activities.,648,668,0.46,0.74,21,B,A,295_21
295,"But even if the primary purpose isn't religious, if the effect is to support religion, it could still be a problem under the Establishment Clause.",668,696,0.66,0.46,22,B,A,295_22
295,"So, considering both Equal Protection and Establishment Clause issues.",696,708,0.62,0.66,23,B,A,295_23
295,The main issue here is whether the state is treating the church differently without a just reason.,708,726,0.6,0.62,24,B,A,295_24
295,"Selling at a below-market price without competitive bidding seems like unequal treatment, violating equal protection.",726,744,0.9,0.6,25,B,A,295_25
295,"Additionally, transferring property to a church might give the appearance of supporting religion, which could also violate the Establishment Clause.",744,766,0.96,0.9,26,B,A,295_26
295,But which issue is more significant here?,766,775,0.7916666666666666,0.96,27,B,A,295_27
295,"The question is about whether the law is constitutional, so both could apply.",775,790,0.88,0.7916666666666666,28,B,A,295_28
295,"However, the primary issue might be the equal protection because the law is specifically authorizing a special sale without competitive bidding, which seems like a clear violation of equal protection.",790,824,0.86,0.88,29,B,A,295_29
295,"The Establishment Clause issue is also present, but the key point is the lack of competitive bidding.",824,842,1.0,0.86,30,B,A,295_30
309,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which value Arthur believes is more fundamental than rights and desert.",91,113,0.56,0.54,0,D,C,309_0
309,"The options are justice, fairness, respect for other persons, or all of the above.",113,131,0.56,0.56,1,D,C,309_1
309,"I remember that in some philosophical discussions, especially those influenced by Kantian ethics, respect for other persons is often considered a fundamental value.",131,158,0.92,0.56,2,D,C,309_2
309,"Rights and desert are important, but they might stem from the basic respect for individuals.",158,175,0.82,0.92,3,D,C,309_3
309,Justice and fairness are related but could be seen as applications of that respect.,175,190,0.96,0.82,4,D,C,309_4
309,"So, putting it all together, respect for other persons seems like the most fundamental.",190,207,1.0,0.96,5,D,C,309_5
309,"Therefore, the answer is probably (C).",207,216,1.0,1.0,6,D,C,309_6
309,"But wait, could it be (D) all of the above?",216,230,1.0,1.0,7,D,C,309_7
309,"Maybe justice and fairness are also fundamental, but I think respect is the base.",230,246,1.0,1.0,8,D,C,309_8
324,"Alright, so I have this question about epigenetics and a study by Moshe Szyf and colleagues.",110,134,0.12,0.08,0,B,D,324_0

339,"First, I need to consider the legal aspect.",195,206,0.5,0.58,3,A,C,339_3
339,I remember that healthcare providers often have policies regarding cancellations.,206,218,0.72,0.5,4,A,C,339_4
339,"Typically, if a patient cancels an appointment with less than 24 hours' notice, the provider might charge a fee or bill the insurance company for the missed session.",218,253,0.86,0.72,5,A,C,339_5
339,I think this is common and probably allowed under the terms of the insurance contracts.,253,269,0.78,0.86,6,A,C,339_6

371,"First, I'll try to understand what each option is saying.",154,168,0.76,0.7,2,C,D,371_2
371,Option A says both ethics and science seek to provide true beliefs about the world.,168,185,0.86,0.76,3,C,D,371_3
371,That makes sense because science aims to discover truths about the universe through observation and experimentation.,185,202,0.86,0.86,4,C,D,371_4
371,"Ethics, on the other hand, deals with moral truths, like what's right or wrong.",202,221,0.96,0.86,5,C,D,371_5

371,"So, both are important for a meaningful life, which seems correct.",280,293,0.98,0.98,10,C,D,371_10
371,Option C states both involve testing general principles by examining their logical consequences.,293,308,0.98,0.98,11,C,D,371_11

375,That feels relevant.,222,225,1.0,1.0,8,A,B,375_8
375,Option C mentions reconciling conflicting moral theories.,225,235,1.0,1.0,9,A,B,375_9
375,That's a bit abstract and might be more about theoretical discussions rather than a practical paralysis.,235,252,1.0,1.0,10,A,B,375_10

399,"I'm not entirely sure, but I'll try to break it down.",134,148,0.64,0.62,2,B,A,399_2
399,"First, antisocial personality traits are often associated with behaviors like deceitfulness, manipulation, and a disregard for social norms.",148,173,0.68,0.64,3,B,A,399_3
399,"People with these traits might struggle with learning, especially if learning environments are structured in ways that require cooperation, empathy, or adherence to rules.",173,200,0.64,0.68,4,B,A,399_4
399,Looking at the options:,200,205,0.72,0.64,5,B,A,399_5
399,A) Social ostracism: This is being excluded or ignored by others.,205,222,0.52,0.72,6,B,A,399_6
399,Antisocial individuals might already feel detached or distrustful.,222,234,0.86,0.52,7,B,A,399_7
399,"If they're ostracized, it could worsen their willingness to engage in learning, maybe making them more resistant.",234,257,0.94,0.86,8,B,A,399_8
399,"B) Money: Financial incentives might influence behavior, but antisocial personalities might be more motivated by immediate gains rather than long-term learning.",257,285,0.86,0.94,9,B,A,399_9
399,I'm not sure how effective money is here.,285,294,0.84,0.86,10,B,A,399_10
399,"C) Tranquilizers: These could reduce anxiety or hyperactivity, which might help focus.",294,314,0.9,0.84,11,B,A,399_11
399,"But antisocial traits might not stem from such issues, so the effect might be limited.",314,331,0.96,0.9,12,B,A,399_12
399,"D) Physical punishment: This could lead to fear or resentment, which might actually increase antisocial behaviors rather than improve learning.",331,356,0.98,0.96,13,B,A,399_13
399,"I'm leaning towards social ostracism because antisocial individuals might avoid learning if they feel excluded, which could reinforce their negative behaviors.",356,384,0.98,0.98,14,B,A,399_14
408,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which of these statements about the consequences of an adaptive metabolic demand on protein requirements is correct.",159,187,0.46,0.4,0,B,C,408_0
408,"I remember from my studies that nitrogen balance studies are used to determine protein requirements, but I'm a bit fuzzy on how adaptation plays into this.",187,215,0.34,0.46,1,B,C,408_1
408,"First, let's break down each option:",215,224,0.48,0.34,2,B,C,408_2
408,Option A says adaptation is fully accounted for in nitrogen balance studies.,224,238,0.42,0.48,3,B,C,408_3
408,I don't think that's right.,238,246,0.3469387755102041,0.42,4,B,C,408_4
408,"Adaptation can vary between individuals and situations, and I don't recall studies fully accounting for all possible adaptations.",246,267,0.36,0.3469387755102041,5,B,C,408_5
408,Option B claims that adaptive metabolic demand means the slope of N-balance studies underestimates protein efficiency.,267,289,0.48,0.36,6,B,C,408_6
408,I'm not too sure about this.,289,297,0.54,0.48,7,B,C,408_7
408,"The slope in N-balance studies usually reflects how much nitrogen is retained, but I'm not certain if adaptation would make this less efficient.",297,324,0.72,0.54,8,B,C,408_8
408,Option C suggests variable adaptation between studies is accounted for by using EAR+2SD.,324,342,0.56,0.72,9,B,C,408_9
408,That sounds familiar.,342,346,0.98,0.56,10,B,C,408_10
408,"EAR is the Estimated Average Requirement, and 2SD accounts for variability.",346,361,0.98,0.98,11,B,C,408_11
408,So maybe this is correct because it includes a buffer for different adaptations.,361,374,0.98,0.98,12,B,C,408_12
408,Option D says adaptation shouldn't influence N-balance interpretations.,374,387,0.98,0.98,13,B,C,408_13
408,"That doesn't make sense because adaptation definitely affects how much protein is needed, so it must play a role.",387,408,0.98,0.98,14,B,C,408_14
490,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which statement about the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is true.",139,166,0.8,0.8367346938775511,0,D,B,490_0
490,"I remember that the TMJ is a joint in the jaw, and it's a bit complex because it's involved in both movement and function like chewing and speaking.",166,199,0.8958333333333334,0.8,1,D,B,490_1
490,Let me break down each option to see which one is correct.,199,211,0.8,0.8958333333333334,2,D,B,490_2
490,Option A says it has an articular disc of hyaline cartilage.,211,228,0.84,0.8,3,D,B,490_3
490,"I think hyaline cartilage is the type that covers joint surfaces, but I'm not sure if the TMJ has a disc made of that.",228,259,0.94,0.84,4,D,B,490_4
490,"I recall that the TMJ has a disc, but is it hyaline?",259,276,0.84,0.94,5,D,B,490_5
490,Maybe it's fibrocartilage instead because discs in some joints are made of that.,276,294,0.92,0.84,6,D,B,490_6
490,So A might not be correct.,294,300,0.9375,0.92,7,D,B,490_7
490,Option B states that its articular surfaces are covered by hyaline cartilage.,300,318,0.9,0.9375,8,D,B,490_8
490,"From what I remember, articular cartilage in most joints is hyaline, so this makes sense.",318,340,0.88,0.9,9,D,B,490_9
490,"The TMJ's surfaces should have hyaline cartilage, so B seems plausible.",340,357,0.86,0.88,10,D,B,490_10
490,Options C and D are about proprioceptive information.,357,368,0.98,0.86,11,D,B,490_11
490,Proprioception relates to position sense.,368,376,0.98,0.98,12,D,B,490_12
490,The chorda tympani is a nerve that carries taste from the tongue and also has some sensory functions.,376,398,0.98,0.98,13,D,B,490_13
490,"The deep temporal nerves are motor to the temporalis muscle, but I'm not sure about their sensory role.",398,420,0.98,0.98,14,D,B,490_14
490,"On the other hand, the masseteric nerve is motor to the masseter, and the auriculotemporal carries sensory from the ear and skin.",420,453,0.98,0.98,15,D,B,490_15
490,"Wait, I think the deep temporal nerve might have a sensory role in the joint.",453,470,0.98,0.98,16,D,B,490_16
490,Maybe the chorda tympani isn't involved in proprioception here.,470,485,0.98,0.98,17,D,B,490_17
490,So C might be wrong.,485,490,0.98,0.98,18,D,B,490_18
490,Options D mentions masseteric and auriculotemporal nerves carrying proprioception.,490,509,0.98,0.98,19,D,B,490_19
490,I'm not sure about the masseteric nerve; I think it's mainly motor.,509,527,0.98,0.98,20,D,B,490_20
490,"The auriculotemporal might carry some sensory info, but I'm not certain if these are the ones handling proprioception in the TMJ.",527,558,0.98,0.98,21,D,B,490_21
490,Maybe the deep temporal nerve is the one with sensory fibers for the joint.,558,572,0.98,0.98,22,D,B,490_22
490,"So, putting it together, B seems correct because the articular surfaces are covered by hyaline cartilage.",572,596,0.98,0.98,23,D,B,490_23
1188,"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the Dickey-Fuller test statistic.",186,208,0.1,0.08,0,A,D,1188_0

1188,"A unit root can cause the time series to have unpredictable behavior, like random walks.",274,290,0.04,0.14,4,A,D,1188_4
1188,"The test statistic in the Dickey-Fuller test follows a specific distribution, often referred to as the Dickey-Fuller distribution.",290,319,0.06,0.04,5,A,D,1188_5
1188,I think this distribution is non-standard and isn't the same as a normal distribution.,319,336,0.16,0.06,6,A,D,1188_6
1188,"That makes me think that options A and B, which refer to the tails of a normal distribution, might not be correct.",336,361,0.14,0.16,7,A,D,1188_7
1188,"Because if the test statistic follows a different distribution, comparing it to a normal distribution's tails doesn't make sense.",361,383,0.22,0.14,8,A,D,1188_8
1188,Option C says the test statistic is obtained from an analytical formula for the density of the Dickey-Fuller distribution.,383,408,0.2,0.22,9,A,D,1188_9
1188,I recall that the exact distribution of the Dickey-Fuller test statistic is complicated and is usually approximated using Monte Carlo simulations rather than an analytical formula.,408,440,0.56,0.2,10,A,D,1188_10
1188,"So, C doesn't seem right either.",440,448,0.74,0.56,11,A,D,1188_11
1188,"That leaves option D, which states that the test statistic is more negative for a 10% size test than a 5% test.",448,478,0.84,0.74,12,A,D,1188_12
1188,I know that the critical values for hypothesis tests depend on the significance level.,478,493,0.64,0.84,13,A,D,1188_13
1188,A lower significance level (like 5%) requires a more extreme test statistic to reject the null hypothesis compared to a higher significance level (like 10%).,493,525,0.68,0.64,14,A,D,1188_14
1188,"Since the test statistic is more negative (i.e., has a larger absolute value), it would more likely fall into the rejection region at the 10% level than the 5% level.",525,565,0.96,0.68,15,A,D,1188_15
1188,"So, D makes sense because a higher significance level corresponds to a less negative critical value, meaning the test statistic needs to be more negative to reject the null at 10% than at 5%.",565,605,0.98,0.96,16,A,D,1188_16

1249,"First, I need to remember what catharsis means in psychoanalysis.",177,193,0.1,0.06,3,C,B,1249_3
1249,"From what I recall, catharsis refers to the process where a client releases repressed emotions, usually through talking about them in therapy.",193,221,0.12,0.1,4,C,B,1249_4
1249,This release is supposed to provide relief from emotional distress.,221,231,0.12,0.12,5,C,B,1249_5
1249,"Now, looking at the answer choices from a behaviorist perspective.",231,245,0.18,0.12,6,C,B,1249_6

1249,"So, I should think about how behaviorists would describe a similar process.",258,272,0.36,0.24,8,C,B,1249_8
1249,Option A says a decrease in affective responses because of therapeutic directions.,272,287,0.3,0.36,9,C,B,1249_9
1249,"That sounds a bit like the therapist telling the client to calm down, but catharsis is more about expressing emotions rather than just reducing them.",287,315,0.46,0.3,10,C,B,1249_10
1249,Option B is redirection of anxiety because of therapeutic influences.,315,327,0.38,0.46,11,C,B,1249_11
1249,"Behaviorists might use techniques like systematic desensitization, where anxiety is redirected to a less harmful response.",327,349,0.74,0.38,12,C,B,1249_12

1249,"So, comparing these, option B seems the best fit.",452,465,1.0,1.0,19,C,B,1249_19
1347,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this law question about arson.",218,234,0.28,0.33,0,D,B,1347_0
1347,Let me start by understanding the scenario.,234,242,0.34,0.28,1,D,B,1347_1
1347,There's a defendant and his friend who were drinking heavily at the friend's house.,242,259,0.42,0.34,2,D,B,1347_2
1347,"They both got intoxicated, passed out, and then the defendant woke up with a headache.",259,277,0.4,0.42,3,D,B,1347_3
1347,"He went to the kitchen, had some whiskey, and made eggs.",277,291,0.22,0.4,4,D,B,1347_4
1347,"But he forgot to turn off the stove, causing a gas leak, fire, and the house burned down.",291,312,0.22,0.22,5,D,B,1347_5
1347,The question is whether the defendant is guilty of arson.,312,324,0.18,0.22,6,D,B,1347_6
1347,"The answer choices are about recklessness, criminal negligence, not guilty because it's not a felony, or not guilty because arson requires malice.",324,352,0.2,0.18,7,D,B,1347_7
1347,"First, I need to recall what arson entails.",352,363,0.12,0.2,8,D,B,1347_8
1347,Arson is typically the intentional setting of fire to a building or property.,363,378,0.3,0.12,9,D,B,1347_9
1347,"But sometimes, it can also apply to fires caused by reckless or negligent actions, depending on the jurisdiction.",378,398,0.46,0.3,10,D,B,1347_10
1347,The defendant was intoxicated.,398,404,0.42,0.46,11,D,B,1347_11
1347,"His actions were: waking up, having a drink, making eggs, forgetting to turn off the stove.",404,425,0.12,0.42,12,D,B,1347_12
1347,"So, he created a fire hazard by leaving the stove on, leading to a gas leak and fire.",425,445,0.26,0.12,13,D,B,1347_13
1347,"Now, intoxication can sometimes affect criminal liability.",445,456,0.2,0.26,14,D,B,1347_14
1347,"Generally, voluntary intoxication (like getting drunk on purpose) doesn't excuse crimes that are based on negligence or recklessness.",456,481,0.2,0.2,15,D,B,1347_15
1347,"It might reduce liability if the crime requires specific intent, but arson doesn't necessarily require intent to cause harm—it can be based on the act of starting a fire regardless of intent, especially if done recklessly.",481,522,0.28,0.2,16,D,B,1347_16
1347,"In this case, the defendant's actions were negligent.",522,534,0.68,0.28,17,D,B,1347_17
1347,He was making eggs and forgot to turn off the stove.,534,546,0.62,0.68,18,D,B,1347_18
1347,"That seems like a failure to exercise reasonable care, which is criminal negligence.",546,561,0.96,0.62,19,D,B,1347_19
1347,"Even though he was intoxicated, voluntary intoxication doesn't negate negligence.",561,575,1.0,0.96,20,D,B,1347_20
1347,"So, his negligence led to the fire, which would satisfy the elements of arson in many jurisdictions.",575,594,1.0,1.0,21,D,B,1347_21
1347,Looking at the answer choices: (A) says guilty because reckless.,594,609,1.0,1.0,22,D,B,1347_22
1347,(B) says guilty because criminally negligent.,609,619,1.0,1.0,23,D,B,1347_23
1347,(C) not guilty because no felony.,619,628,1.0,1.0,24,D,B,1347_24
1347,(D) not guilty because arson needs malice.,628,638,1.0,1.0,25,D,B,1347_25
1347,"Arson typically requires either intent, recklessness, or criminal negligence.",638,653,1.0,1.0,26,D,B,1347_26
1347,"So, the defendant's actions meet the standard for criminal negligence, making (B) a strong option.",653,674,1.0,1.0,27,D,B,1347_27
1347,"As for (D), malice is usually associated with intent to harm, which isn't clearly present here, but some jurisdictions might still hold him liable under negligence.",674,706,1.0,1.0,28,D,B,1347_28
1362,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this medical question.",138,152,0.7755102040816326,0.64,0,D,C,1362_0
1362,Let's read it again carefully.,152,159,0.76,0.7755102040816326,1,D,C,1362_1
1362,A 65-year-old woman comes in with aphasia and right-sided hemiparesis.,159,179,0.68,0.76,2,D,C,1362_2
1362,Then she develops urinary incontinence.,179,187,0.82,0.68,3,D,C,1362_3
1362,"No UTI is found, and she has no prior urinary issues.",187,201,0.7,0.82,4,D,C,1362_4
1362,The options are about different types of neurogenic bladders.,201,212,0.68,0.7,5,D,C,1362_5
1362,"First, let me remember what these terms mean.",212,223,0.6326530612244898,0.68,6,D,C,1362_6
1362,"Aphasia is a language impairment, often due to a stroke or brain injury.",223,239,0.62,0.6326530612244898,7,D,C,1362_7
1362,Hemiparesis means weakness on one side of the body.,239,252,0.68,0.62,8,D,C,1362_8
1362,"So she probably had a stroke, maybe in the left hemisphere since aphasia is common with left-brain strokes.",252,275,0.8,0.68,9,D,C,1362_9
1362,"Now, she's developed urinary incontinence.",275,285,0.72,0.8,10,D,C,1362_10
1362,Neurogenic bladder disorders happen when the nervous system doesn't control the bladder properly.,285,303,0.5625,0.72,11,D,C,1362_11
1362,"The types mentioned here are autonomic, motor paralytic, reflex, and uninhibited.",303,322,0.82,0.5625,12,D,C,1362_12
1362,"I think autonomic neurogenic bladder is when there's a problem with the autonomic nerves, which control internal functions.",322,347,0.84,0.82,13,D,C,1362_13
1362,This might lead to things like dysuria or hesitancy.,347,360,0.76,0.84,14,D,C,1362_14
1362,"Motor paralytic bladder would be if the muscles are weak or paralyzed, maybe from spinal cord injury above the thoracic spine.",360,386,0.96,0.76,15,D,C,1362_15
1362,"Reflex bladder is when the bladder has an overactive or hyperreflexive state, often seen in upper motor neuron lesions like in stroke.",386,414,1.0,0.96,16,D,C,1362_16
1362,"Uninhibited bladder sounds like it can't hold urine, maybe with a loss of the inhibitory mechanism.",414,435,1.0,1.0,17,D,C,1362_17
1362,"In this case, the patient had a stroke, which is an upper motor neuron injury.",435,454,1.0,1.0,18,D,C,1362_18
1362,"After a stroke, especially in the left hemisphere, the bladder can become hyperactive.",454,471,1.0,1.0,19,D,C,1362_19
1362,Reflex neurogenic bladder fits because the reflexes are exaggerated.,471,483,1.0,1.0,20,D,C,1362_20
1362,So the bladder might not store properly and can cause incontinence due to overactivity.,483,500,1.0,1.0,21,D,C,1362_21
1362,Let me check each option.,500,507,1.0,1.0,22,D,C,1362_22
1362,"Autonomic neurogenic bladder might present with symptoms like difficulty starting urination or needing to push, but I don't think that's the main issue here.",507,538,1.0,1.0,23,D,C,1362_23
1362,"Motor paralytic is more about the muscles not working, maybe from spinal issues.",538,555,1.0,1.0,24,D,C,1362_24
1362,"Uninhibited sounds like it's always leaking, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.",555,576,1.0,1.0,25,D,C,1362_25
1362,So I'm leaning towards reflex neurogenic bladder as the most likely diagnosis.,576,592,1.0,1.0,26,D,C,1362_26
1436,"Okay, so I need to figure out what the core of the absolutist position is according to Nagel.",112,135,0.62,0.42,0,D,A,1436_0
1436,"The options are A, B, C, D.",135,146,0.6,0.62,1,D,A,1436_1
1436,Let's break this down.,146,151,0.7,0.6,2,D,A,1436_2
1436,"First, I remember that absolutist positions in ethics often refer to a view where certain moral principles are considered to be absolutely binding, regardless of the situation.",151,183,0.78,0.7,3,D,A,1436_3
1436,"For example, some might say that killing is always wrong, no matter the circumstances.",183,199,0.84,0.78,4,D,A,1436_4
1436,"Looking at the options, option A says ""human persons have a right to life."" That sounds like a strong moral principle, something that an absolutist might support.",199,233,1.0,0.84,5,D,A,1436_5
1436,"It suggests that no matter what, human life is protected.",233,244,1.0,1.0,6,D,A,1436_6
1436,Option B is about permissible harm as a foreseen but unintended consequence.,244,259,1.0,1.0,7,D,A,1436_7
1436,"That sounds more like a consequentialist view, where the morality of an action is based on the outcomes.",259,280,1.0,1.0,8,D,A,1436_8
1436,"If harm is foreseen but not intended, it might be permissible, which doesn't sound like the core of an absolutist position.",280,306,1.0,1.0,9,D,A,1436_9
1436,"Option C is ""the ends justify the means."" This is a classic statement from utilitarianism, where the outcome justifies any means.",306,335,1.0,1.0,10,D,A,1436_10
1436,Absolutists typically reject this because they believe certain actions are wrong regardless of the outcome.,335,352,1.0,1.0,11,D,A,1436_11
1436,"Option D says ""the hostility should be directed at its true object."" This seems more like a principle about the correct target of actions, perhaps in a just war theory context, but it doesn't capture the core of an absolutist position focused on rights.",352,403,1.0,1.0,12,D,A,1436_12
1515,"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the action described is ethical or not.",132,151,0.64,0.6,0,A,B,1515_0
1515,Let me break it down.,151,157,0.64,0.64,1,A,B,1515_1
1515,A psychologist does an assessment on a patient and then refers them to another psychologist for therapy.,157,176,0.62,0.64,2,A,B,1515_2
1515,"The therapist then asks for a consultation from the referring psychologist, gets it, and pays for it.",176,196,0.56,0.62,3,A,B,1515_3
1515,The question is whether this is ethical.,196,203,0.56,0.56,4,A,B,1515_4
1515,"First, I remember that in psychology, there are ethical guidelines about referrals and consultations.",203,221,0.6,0.56,5,A,B,1515_5
1515,One key thing is informed consent.,221,228,0.62,0.6,6,A,B,1515_6
1515,The patient should be aware of any consultations involving their records.,228,240,0.7,0.62,7,A,B,1515_7
1515,"But in this case, the therapist is paying for the consultation, not the patient.",240,256,0.58,0.7,8,A,B,1515_8
1515,I'm also thinking about dual relationships.,256,265,0.62,0.58,9,A,B,1515_9
1515,Psychologists should avoid dual relationships because they can complicate the therapeutic relationship.,265,280,0.36,0.62,10,A,B,1515_10
1515,"If the therapist is paying the referring psychologist, that might create a financial dependency or a conflict of interest.",280,301,0.9,0.36,11,A,B,1515_11
1515,This could potentially harm the patient's treatment.,301,309,0.96,0.9,12,A,B,1515_12
1515,Another point is about confidentiality.,309,316,0.96,0.96,13,A,B,1515_13
1515,The referring psychologist has information about the patient from the assessment.,316,328,0.98,0.96,14,A,B,1515_14
1515,"If the therapist is paying for the consultation, does that mean the therapist is influencing how the information is shared?",328,350,0.98,0.98,15,A,B,1515_15
1515,"Maybe the therapist is trying to get specific insights, which could be against the patient's best interest.",350,369,0.98,0.98,16,A,B,1515_16
1515,I also recall that some ethical codes prohibit psychologists from accepting payments for services from third parties that could influence their judgment.,369,393,0.98,0.98,17,A,B,1515_17
1515,"Paying for a consultation might be seen as a form of inducement, which could be unethical.",393,413,0.98,0.98,18,A,B,1515_18
1515,"Wait, but could there be a situation where paying for the consultation is okay?",413,430,0.98,0.98,19,A,B,1515_19
1515,"Maybe if it's part of a supervision arrangement, but the question doesn't mention that.",430,448,0.98,0.98,20,A,B,1515_20
1515,"The answer choice D talks about supervision, but the action here doesn't specify that.",448,464,0.98,0.98,21,A,B,1515_21
1515,"So, putting it all together, the therapist paying for the consultation seems to create a conflict of interest and could undermine the patient's trust.",464,493,0.98,0.98,22,A,B,1515_22
1579,"Okay, so I need to figure out which of the two scenarios involves the main character doing something morally wrong according to ordinary US morals in 2020.",160,194,0.02,0.02,0,C,D,1579_0
1579,Let's break down each scenario one by one.,194,203,0.04,0.02,1,C,D,1579_1
1579,"Starting with Scenario 1: ""I wanted to shake hands with everybody, especially the black guy."" Hmm, the main character here seems eager to shake hands with everyone, but they specifically mention wanting to shake hands with a black guy.",203,251,0.02,0.04,2,C,D,1579_2
1579,"Now, I'm trying to think about whether this is morally wrong.",251,265,0.06,0.02,3,C,D,1579_3
1579,"At first glance, wanting to shake hands with someone doesn't seem bad.",265,280,0.06,0.06,4,C,D,1579_4
1579,"In fact, it's usually seen as a positive social gesture.",280,293,0.12,0.06,5,C,D,1579_5
1579,"However, the emphasis on the person being black might raise some flags.",293,307,0.1,0.12,6,C,D,1579_6
1579,Could this be seen as objectifying or having inappropriate intentions?,307,319,0.1,0.1,7,C,D,1579_7
1579,"Maybe the person is being overly focused on someone's race, which could be interpreted as discriminatory or having underlying biases.",319,342,0.14,0.1,8,C,D,1579_8
1579,But I'm not entirely sure if just wanting to shake hands with someone of a different race is wrong.,342,363,0.08,0.14,9,C,D,1579_9
1579,"It might just be a genuine desire to connect with others, but the wording does make me question the intent.",363,384,0.08,0.08,10,C,D,1579_10
1579,"Now moving on to Scenario 2: ""I did not slam on my brakes to avoid hitting the animal as it ran in front of my car."" Here, the main character chose not to slam on the brakes and potentially hit an animal.",384,433,0.06,0.08,11,C,D,1579_11
1579,I need to assess if this action is morally wrong.,433,444,0.1,0.06,12,C,D,1579_12
1579,"In most cases, people would consider it compassionate to avoid hitting an animal, especially if it's in front of the car.",444,469,0.2,0.1,13,C,D,1579_13
1579,"However, failing to slam on the brakes could have consequences for the driver's safety or others in the vehicle.",469,491,0.16,0.2,14,C,D,1579_14
1579,"If the driver was unable to stop in time, hitting the animal might have been unavoidable.",491,509,0.1,0.16,15,C,D,1579_15
1579,But the question is whether the decision not to slam on the brakes is wrong.,509,525,0.14,0.1,16,C,D,1579_16
1579,"I think most people would say it's not wrong; in fact, it might be seen as kind.",525,546,0.22,0.14,17,C,D,1579_17
1579,"However, if the action led to harm, like an accident, that could be a different story.",546,566,0.1,0.22,18,C,D,1579_18
1579,"But based on the scenario given, it just says they didn't slam on the brakes, not that they hit the animal.",566,591,0.32,0.1,19,C,D,1579_19
1579,"So, I don't think this is clearly morally wrong.",591,602,0.38,0.32,20,C,D,1579_20
1579,"Putting it together, Scenario 1 might involve some questionable intent, but it's not necessarily wrong.",602,623,0.96,0.38,21,C,D,1579_21
1579,"Scenario 2 doesn't seem wrong because avoiding hitting an animal is generally considered a positive action, unless it leads to another harm, which isn't mentioned here.",623,655,1.0,0.96,22,C,D,1579_22
